Q1:
import os
print(os.environ)
os.environ has the environment variables, which we can just print.

Q2:
import os
print(os.environ['QUERY_STRING'])
QUERY_STRING is the parameter that contains the query parameter data.

Q3:
import os
print(os.environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])
The environment variable HTTP_USER_AGENT is the variable that contains the user's browser information.

Q4:
content_length = os.environ['CONTENT_LENGTH']
if content_length:
      bytes_to_read = int(content_length)
      content = sys.stdin.read(bytes_to_read)
      print("<pre>"+content+"</pre>")

The data from a POST request comes into the CGI script from standard input. In order to output the data, the POSTed data is sent to the script as number of bytes which is sent in the environment variable CONTENT_LENGTH. We can read the input by telling the browser how many bytes of the standard input to read.

Q5:
print("Set-Cookie: logged_in")
print
This sets the cookie in the header and then ends the HTTP header.

Q6:
os.environ['HTTP_COOKIE']
The browser sends the cookie back in the environmental variable HTTP_COOKIE -- which is actually a string, so we need to parse out the cookie.
